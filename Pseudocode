# Goals:
# - 7 endings
# - include a system that can increase/decrease the likelihood of a specific situation(s) happening, based on your choices in the story.
# - use a loop as the "core" of the program

"""
Main Story:
You and a crewmate are stranded on a unknown alien spaceship.
You and your crewmate decided to split off.
Your objective is to find any means escaping the spaceship.

# pseudocode the main function of the game. (As of September 20th, 2021)

// let user_inventory = (...) < - list
# Have a list that stores objects/items into the user's inventory (default would be none)

// have a dictionary called - items = {...} < - dictionary
# Have a dictionary that stores items with respective items (particularly weapons with their damage values)

// let variable = a
#changes the value into a negative or positive by a certain about (max two decimal places, ie (1.25)) [.75,1.5]

#negative leads to more dangerous situations, positive leds to more peaceful/safe situations.
# dont USE NEGATIVE, use a number that goes from 0 to 10 etc.

Ideas:
Create a RPG (focused on fighting/inventory/character)
Create a story-based adventure game (focused on story, choices impacts later playerâ€™s decisions)
